# VaporDocC-website

The docker container used to host [vapordocc.josephduffy.co.uk](https://vapordocc.josephduffy.co.uk/).

The website hosts the documentation for [VaporDocC](https://github.com/JosephDuffy/VaporDocC), which is Vapor middleware that serves files from a DocC archive.

The configuration – along with examples for Netlify, nginx, and Apache – are discussed further on my blog:
